									<a href="#">Hi, I'm Daniel</a>
								</h2>
							</header>
			
							<p>I'm an undergraduate at Yale-NUS (class of '19), currently majoring in Computer Science. I've been wanting to start a
								programming blog for a while now, but I realized I simply hadn't had enough experience coding to have anything interesting
								or useful to say. Upon realizing this, I set myself a personal challenge:</p>
							<blockquote>Always be working on at least one extracurricular coding project.</blockquote>
			
							<p>It's been about eight months since I set that goal, and I can say that it's been the busiest I've ever been. However,
								the amount I've learned has only inspired me to keep going further. Tech is such an intensely fast-paced field, and
								I've come to realize that the only way to keep up is to be passionate about learning new things.</p>
			
							<p>Along the way (especially when working on web development projects), there have been many times where I've felt a bit
								overwhelmed at the sheer number of libraries, frameworks, and languages that a programmer "ought to learn" in order
								to stay relevant. In fact, I <i>still</i> feel this way very often. However, I think it's important to take things step-by-step.
								My journey into the world of coding has only just begun, but I hope that in this blog, you'll find something that helps
								you move forward as well.</p>
